Resizing a datastore enables you to increase or decrease the storage for your virtual machine files. You might need to change the size of a datastore as your infrastructure requirements change.

*About this task*

If you want VSC to resize the containing volume when it resizes the VMFS datastore, you should not use the *Use existing volume* option under Storage attributes section when initially provisioning VMFS datastore, but instead let it automatically create a new volume for each datastore.

You can increase or decrease the size of an NFS datastore but for a VMFS datastore, you can only increase the size. Resizing of datastore is also supported for FlexGroup datastores with auto grow and shrink option. A FlexGroup that is part of a traditional datastore and FlexVol volume that is part of a vVols datastore cannot shrink below the existing size but can grow by 120% maximum. Default snapshots are enabled on these FlexGroup and FlexVol volumes.

NOTE: If you are using All SAN Array (ASA) type storage platforms with ONTAP 9.9.1 or later, only then you can create vVols datastores with vmdk size greater than 16TB.

*Steps*

. From the vSphere Client Home page, click *Hosts and Clusters*.
. In the navigation pane, select the datacenter that contains the datastore.
. Right-click the datastore and select *NetApp ONTAP tools* > *Assign QoS*.
. In the Resize dialog box, specify a new size for the datastore, and then click *OK*.

You can run the *REDISCOVER ALL* option in the Storage Systems menu to manually update the storage listing under Storage Systems and dashboard, or wait for the next scheduled refresh.
