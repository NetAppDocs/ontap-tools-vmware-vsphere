You can check the log files in the `/opt/netapp/vscserver/log` directory and the `/opt/netapp/vpserver/log` directory when you encounter errors.

The following three log files can be helpful in identifying problems:

* `cxf.log`, containing information about API traffic into and out of VASA Provider
*`kaminoPrefs.xml`, containing information about VSC settings
* `vvolvp.log`, containing all log information about VASA Provider

The maintenance menu of ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere enables you to set different log levels for your requirement. The following log levels are available:

* Info
* Debug
* Error
* Trace

When you set the log levels, the following files are updated:

* VSC server: `kamino.log` and `vvolvp.log`
* VASA Provider server: `vvolvp.log`, `error.log`, and `netapp.log`

In addition, the VASA Provider web command-line interface (CLI) page contains the API calls that were made, the errors that were returned, and several performance-related counters. The web CLI page is located at `https://<IP_address_or_hostname>:9083/stats`.
