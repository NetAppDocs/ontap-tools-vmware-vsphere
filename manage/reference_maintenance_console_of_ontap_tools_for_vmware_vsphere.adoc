You can manage your application, system, and network configurations by using the maintenance console of the ONTAP tools. You can change your administrator password and maintenance password. You can also generate support bundles, set different log levels, view and manage TLS configurations, and start remote diagnostics.

You must have installed VMware tools after deploying ONTAP tools to access the maintenance console. You should use "`maint`" as the user name and the password you configured during deployment to log in to the maintenance console of the ONTAP tools.

NOTE: You must set a password for the "`diag`" user while enabling remote diagnostics.

You should use the Summary tab of your deployed ONTAP tools to access the maintenance console. When you click  image:../media/launch_maintenance_console.gif[], the maintenance console starts.
