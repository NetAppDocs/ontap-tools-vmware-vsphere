You can set timeouts and other values on the ESXi hosts using ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere to ensure best performance and successful failover. The values that ONTAP tools sets are based on internal NetApp testing.

You can set the following values on an ESXi host:

== ESXi advanced configuration

* *VMFS3.HardwareAcceleratedLocking*
+
You should set this value to 1.

* *VMFS3.EnableBlockDelete*
+
You should set this value to 0.

== NFS settings

* *Net.TcpipHeapSize*
+
If you are using vSphere 6.0 or later, you should set this value to 32.

* *Net.TcpipHeapMax*
+
You should set this value to 512MB for vSphere 6.X releases, except for 6.5U3 and 6.7U3 releases. For vSphere 6.5U3 and 6.7U3 releases set this value to 1024MB. If you are using vSphere 7.0 or later versions, you should set this value to 1024MB.

* *NFS.MaxVolumes*
+
If you are using vSphere 6.0 or later, you should set this value to 256.

* *NFS41.MaxVolumes*
+
If you are using vSphere 6.0 or later, you should set this value to 256.

* *NFS.MaxQueueDepth*
+
If you are using the vSphere 6.0 or later version of ESXi host, then you should set this value to 128 or higher to avoid queuing bottlenecks.
+
For vSphere versions prior to 6.0, you should set this value to 64.

* *NFS.HeartbeatMaxFailures*
+
You should set this value to 10 for all NFS configurations.

* *NFS.HeartbeatFrequency*
+
You should set this value to 12 for all NFS configurations.

* *NFS.HeartbeatTimeout*
+
You should set this value to 5 for all NFS configurations.

== FC/FCoE settings

* *Path selection policy*
+
You should set this value to "`RR`" (round robin) when FC paths with ALUA are used.
+
You should set this value to "`FIXED`" for all other configurations.
+
Setting this value to "`RR`" helps to provide load balancing across all of the active/optimized paths. The value "`FIXED`" is used for older, non-ALUA configurations and helps to prevent proxy I/O.

* *Disk.QFullSampleSize*
+
You should set this value to 32 for all configurations. Setting this value helps to prevent I/O errors.

* *Disk.QFullThreshold*
+
You should set this value to 8 for all configurations. Setting this value helps prevent I/O errors.

* *Emulex FC HBA timeouts*
+
Use the default value.

* *QLogic FC HBA timeouts*
+
Use the default value.

== iSCSI settings

* *Path selection policy*
+
You should set this value to "`RR`" for all iSCSI paths.
+
Setting this value to "`RR`" helps to provide load balancing across all of the active/optimized paths.

* *Disk.QFullSampleSize*
+
You should set this value to 32 for all configurations. Setting this value helps to prevent I/O errors.

* *Disk.QFullThreshold*
+
You should set this value to 8 for all configurations. Setting this value helps prevent I/O errors.
