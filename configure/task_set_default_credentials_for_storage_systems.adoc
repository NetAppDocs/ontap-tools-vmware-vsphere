You can use ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere to set default credentials for a storage system in your vCenter Server.

*What you will need*

You must have selected the vCenter Server that you want to use for creating default credentials.

*About this task*

If you set up default credentials for storage systems, Virtual Storage Console (VSC) uses these credentials to log in to a storage system that VSC has just discovered. If the default credentials do not work, you must manually log in to the storage system. VSC and SRA support addition of storage system credentials at the cluster level or the SVM level. But VASA Provider will only work with cluster level credentials.

*Steps*

. On the ONTAP tools Home page, click *Settings* > *Administrative Settings* > *Configure Default Credentials for Storage System*.
. In the Storage System Default Credentials dialog box, enter the user name and password for the storage system.
+
Storage controller credentials are assigned in ONTAP based on the user name and password pair. The storage controller credentials can either be the administrator account or a custom account that uses role-based access control (RBAC).
+
You cannot use VSC to change the roles that are associated with the user name and password pair of the storage controller. To modify or create a new ONTAP user role for use with ONTAP tools, you can use System Manager.
+
See the "`Configuring user roles and privileges`" section.

. Click *OK* to save the default credentials.

If you updated the storage system credentials because a storage system reported "`Authentication Failure`" status, you should click the *REDISCOVER ALL* option available on the Storage Systems page. When you do this, VSC tries to connect to the storage system by using the new credentials.
