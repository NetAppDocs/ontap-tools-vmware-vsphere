You can map the datastores that are associated with VASA Provider for ONTAP to storage capability profiles. You can assign a profile to a datastore that is not associated with a storage capability profile.

*What you will need*

* You must have registered your VASA Provider instance with ONTAPÂ® tools for VMware vSphere.
* Virtual Storage Console (VSC) must have already discovered your storage.

You can map traditional datastore with a storage capability profile or change the storage capability profile that is associated with a datastore. VASA Provider does _not_ display any virtual volume (VVol) datastores on the Storage Mappings page. All the datastores that are referred to in this task are traditional datastores.

*Steps*

. From the ONTAP tools Home page, click *Storage Mapping*.
+
From the Storage Mapping page, you can determine the following information:

 ** The vCenter Server that is associated with the datastore
 ** How many profiles match the datastore
+
The Storage Mapping page displays only traditional datastores. This page does not display any VVol datastores or qtree datastores.

 ** Whether the datastore is currently associated with a profile
+
A datastore can match multiple profiles, but a datastore can be associated with only one profile.

 ** Whether the datastore is compliant with the profile that is associated with it

. To map a storage capability profile to a datastore or to change the existing profile of a datastore, select the datastore.
+
To locate specific datastores or other information on the Storage Mapping page, you can enter a name or a partial string in the search box. VSC displays the search results in a dialog box. To return to the full display, you should remove the text from the search box, and then click *Enter*.

. From the Actions menu, select *Assign matching profile*.
. Select the profile that you want to map to the datastore from the list of matching profiles that is provided in the *Assign profile to datastore* dialog box, and then click *OK* to map the selected profile to the datastore.
. Refresh the screen to verify the new assignment.
