You can configure new user roles for managing storage systems using the JSON file provided with ONTAP tools and ONTAP System Manager.

*What you'll need*

* You should have downloaded the ONTAP Privileges file from ONTAP tools using \https://\{virtual_appliance_IP}:9083/vsc/config/VSC_ONTAP_User_Privileges.zip.
* You should have configured ONTAP 9.8P1 or later storage.
* You should have logged in with administrator privileges for the storage system.

*Steps*

. Unzip the downloaded `\https://\{virtual_appliance_IP}:9083/vsc/config/VSC_ONTAP_User_Privileges.zip` file.
. Access ONTAP System Manager.
. Click *CLUSTER* > *Settings* > *Users and Roles*.
. Click *Add User*.
. In the Add User dialog box, select *Virtualization products*.
. Click *Browse* to select and upload the ONTAP Privileges JSON file.
+
The PRODUCT field is auto populated.

. Select the required capability from the PRODUCT CAPABILITY drop-down menu.
+
The *ROLE* field is auto populated based on the product capability selected.

. Enter the required username and password.
. Select the privileges (Discovery, Create Storage, Modify Storage, Destroy Storage) required for the user, and then click *Add*.

The new role and user is added and you can see the detailed privileges under the role that you have configured.

NOTE: The uninstall operation does not remove VSC roles but removes the localized names for the VSC-specific privileges and appends the prefix to "`XXX missing privilege`" them. This behavior happens because the vCenter Server does not provide an option to remove privileges. When you reinstall VSC or upgrade to a newer version of VSC, all of the standard VSC roles and VSC-specific privileges are restored.
