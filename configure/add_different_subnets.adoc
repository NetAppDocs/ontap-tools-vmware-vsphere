You can now add different subnets for datastore mounting using the ONTAP tools interface. Adding different subnets enables communication between ESXi hosts and storage systems configured for cloud environments.

*Steps*

. Log in to your vCenter Server instance and access ONTAP tools.
. On the homepage, click *Settings* > *Manage Subnet Access*.
. In the Manage Subnet Access dialog box, click *Selected* option in Allowed subnets for NFS Subnets Access.
. Enter the values for the required subnets, and then click *ADD*.
. Select either *None* or *Selected* for Restricted subnets.
. Repeat the above steps for iSCSI Subnets Access, and click *Apply*.
