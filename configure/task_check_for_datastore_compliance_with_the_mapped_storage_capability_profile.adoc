You can quickly verify whether your datastores are compliant with the storage capability profiles that are mapped to the datastores.

*What you will need*

* You must have registered your VASA Provider instance with ONTAPÂ® tools for VMware vSphere (VSC).
* VSC must have discovered your storage.

*Steps*

. From the ONTAP tools Home page, click *Storage Mapping*.
. Review the information in the Compliance Status column to identify non-compliant datastores and review the alerts for non-compliance reason.
+
NOTE: When you click the *COMPLIANCE CHECK* button, VSC performs a rediscovery operation for all of the storage, which might take few minutes.
+
If a datastore is no longer compliant with its profile, then the Compliance Status column displays an alert stating the reason for non-compliance. For example, a profile might require compression. If that setting has been changed on the storage, compression is no longer used, and the datastore is non-compliant.

When you discover a datastore that is not compliant with its profile, you can modify the settings on the volume backing the datastore to make the datastore compliant, or you can assign a new profile to the datastore.

You can modify the settings from the Storage Capability Profile page.
