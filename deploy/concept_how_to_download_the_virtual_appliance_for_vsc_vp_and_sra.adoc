The .ova file includes the ONTAP tools. When the deployment is complete, all the three products are installed in your environment. By default, VSC starts working as soon as you decide on the subsequent deployment model and choose whether to enable VASA Provider and SRA based on your requirements.

You can download ONTAP tools from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/vsc/downloads-tab by using the software download page.
