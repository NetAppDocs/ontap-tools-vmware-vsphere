You must map your resources on the protected site and recovery site so that virtual machines are configured to fail over into one group of hosts or the other.

*What you will need*

You must have connected the protected and recovery sites.

NOTE: In Site Recovery Manager (SRM), resources can be resource pools, ESXi hosts, or vSphere clusters.

*Steps*

. Log in to your vCenter Server, and click on *Site Recovery* > *Sites*.
. Select your protected site, and then click *Manage*.
. In the Manage tab, select *Resource Mappings*.
. Click the image:../media/new_resource_mappings.gif[] icon to create a new resource mapping.
+
The Create Resource Mapping wizard appears.

. In the Create Resource Mapping wizard, perform the following:
 .. Select *Automatically Prepare Mappings for Resource with Matching Names*, and click *Next*.
 .. Select the required data center objects for the protected and recovery sites, and click *Add Mappings*.
 .. Click *Next* after mappings are created successfully.
 .. Select the object that was used earlier to create reverse mapping, and then click *Finish*.

*Result*

The Resource Mappings page displays the protected site resources and the recovery site resources. You can follow the same steps for other networks in your environment.
