ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere  supports VMware's SRM Shared Recovery Site Configuration. For more information, see:  https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/live-recovery/site-recovery-manager/8-8/site-recovery-manager-installation-and-configuration-8-8.html[Site Recovery Manager in a Shared Recovery Site Configuration]. The Site Recovery Manager Server instances on the recovery site connect to the same vCenter Server instances.

In a SRM Shared Recovery Site Configuration, each SRM server needs to have a dedicated SRA instance (1:1 relationship between SRM and SRA). Configure OTV in VCF mode to act as a dedicated SRA instance for each SRM server. You can also have a non-SRA enabled ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere appliance deployed that is registered with vCenter and is used for non-SRA tasks such as datastore provisioning.

The https://kb.netapp.com/mgmt/OTV/SRA/Storage_Replication_Adapter%3A_How_to_configure_SRA_in_a_SRM_Shared_Recovery_Site[How to configure SRA in a SRM Shared Recovery Site] KB article details the procedure for setting up SRA to support SRM Shared Recovery Site Configuration.
